# Rock_Paper_Scissors

This is a simple Rock Paper scissors game played within the developer console that uses javascript and multipel different alert class to play along with the user.


Reflection:
From creating this simple console game I had been confronted with multiple problems and I had to overcome them without any foreign help. I head learned to use for loops and also establish different functions.
