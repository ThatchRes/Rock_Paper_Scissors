# Rock_Paper_Scissors

This is a simple Rock Paper scissors game played within the developer console that uses javascript and multipel different alert class to play along with the user. There is an addition of css styles along with a display of the content within the console.


Reflection:
From creating this simple console game I had been confronted with multiple problems and I had to overcome them without any foreign help. I head learned to use for loops and also establish different functions.
